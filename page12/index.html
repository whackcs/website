<p>Due to mitigating circumstances we will not be having our <a href="/batterylife-wi10">maximizing battery talk</a> this week. In lieu of this we will be holding a hackathon in its stead. This <strong><em>Thursday, February 18th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266</em></strong>, we will be hacking on all sorts of code. We have several projects going at the moment that range from python to C and hackers of all skill levels are invited. Whether you know nothing about programming or are a kernel wizard come join us and play around with some code. There will be no formal structure to this meeting, just bring your laptop and/or your brain and you will be able to hack along. You may want to familiarize yourself slightly with the projects in <a href="/git">gitweb</a> and find one or more you may want to work on. Of course you could also bring your own. As always, there will be pizza.</p>

<p>This presentation is going to try and cover a lot of ground, and at variable speed. I am trying to get it into two somewhat logical parts.</p>

<p>First being where I into regex then show its use with sed. Then go into using awk, and finally how to use find.</p>

<p>The second half will try and touch on the rest of the commands, concentrating on grep, xargs, and process management.</p>

<p>I also will leave off with a slide or two of fun one liners, and some bash tricks, that people may find super useful.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/25/gimp-spring-2010/">GIMP - Spring 2010</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-25-2010</span>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Due to inexcusably poor service from classroom services, the meeting was moved to Dreese Lab 305 for the current meeting. We apologize for the short notice, and plan on inquiring into why our room was overbooked without our knowledge.</p>

<p>Thursday, April 1<sup>st</sup>, at 7PM in <s>Dreese Labs 266</s>, Brian Swaney demonstrated how to effectively utilize the open source photo editing suite GIMP.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures. The presentation was therefore interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was encouraged. Questions were also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “what is a layer?” to as advanced as “how do I render lightning bolts?” or anything else you can think of. Comments are enabled, so you can post your ideas ahead of time.</p>

<p>At the meeting, there was a lot of demand for a demonstration of rendering lightning bolts. <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">Here</a> is a copy of the example XCF image I generated. I followed <a href="http://www.gimptalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=122#pagecontent">this tutorial</a> up to the point where they changed the colorization, then instead selected/cut out the bolt by color, applied the neon filter, and flattened the bolt. The image with Richard Stallman and Bill Gates was also popular, so you’ll find it <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those out there who continue to persist that “GIMP is inferior to Photoshop and will never be professional,” well… here is a little something by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/krc453">krc453</a>…</p>

<p>This Thursday, March 11th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be holding a lightning talk session covering a multitude of command line applications. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. If you are looking for a lightweight program to get the job done and don’t need a graphical interface, be it checking your mail, downloading torrents, chatting on irc, editing text, or anything else, this is definitely the meeting for you. If you have found a command line program that has grasped your interest, consider coming in and sharing with the rest of the club as we are all looking for the next best thing. A current list of programs that are going to be covered is in a list below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tmux</li>
  <li>screen</li>
  <li>mplayer</li>
  <li>htop</li>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/25/alternative-window-managers/">Alternative Window Managers</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-25-2010</span>
<p>Thursday February 11th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be discussing alternative open source window managers for Linux. A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. In other words it creates a desktop environment for you to use on your screen. The big two desktop environments are KDE and Gnome, but we are going to discuss some lesser known alternatives to these two. Matt Meinwald will be discussing Fluxbox and XFCE. Dan Thau will be showing DWM, EvilWM and how to operate with no window manager at all. Finally, Alek Rollyson will be showing OpenBox, wmii and Awesome WM. Come join us and learn about some alternative window managers that you can learn about and use!</p>

<p>This Thursday, January 21st at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will have a few people presenting on the topic of virtualization. Dan Thau will be talking about chroot, what chroot is and what chroot is not, as well as give examples for usage and a demo or two. Matt Meinwald will demonstrate Xen, a popular server virtualization system. He will give some background, including the difference between paravirtualization and full machine virtualization, then will show a demo of creating and administering a virtual machine. Alek Rollyson will cover desktop related virtualization tools such as Virtualbox and VMware. He will go over the features of these programs, what systems they support, and how to configure and administer virtual desktops.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2010/01/11/this-week-in-slashdot/">This Week in Slashdot</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-11-2010</span>
<p>This Thursday, January 14th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. Slashdot (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website located at http://slashdot.org that deals in news for the nerdy. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. I hope to see you all there, we love a good discussion!</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2009/12/18/wireless-hacking/">Wireless hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 12-18-2009</span>
<p>This Thursday, January 7th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we are doing a talk and demonstration on hacking wireless networks. There will be 3 parts to the discussion. First, Brian Swaney will be talking about the dangers of poor security. He will go over why wireless communication is inherently insecure, what types of attacks are possible on wireless networks, some techniques common people use to try and secure their networks, and why they ultimately fail. Alek Rollyson will then continue on and talk about the behind the scenes technicalities of the attacks that we will be presenting. He will go over some specific weaknesses in protocols used by wireless routers, how they might be exploited, and how to protect oneself. Finally, Michael Yanovich will show us how to use the aircrack-ng suite to actually perform the attacks. He will show how to exploit all the common mistakes users make in securing their network, all using the free, open source aircrack suite. We look forward to seeing you all there. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This presentation is for <u>educational</u> purposes only. Use of these techniques in a manner other than how they are presented may be in violation of state/federal law, and also totally uncool. We do not condone their use for illegal or nefarious purposes.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2009/12/18/emacs/">emacs</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 12-18-2009</span>
<p>This Thursday, February 25<sup>th</sup>, I, Professor Ed Overman, a professor in the math department at Ohio State University, will be presenting on emacs in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 266. I began using an 026 keypunch machine in my student days (which clearly did not need an editor). My first interactive time-sharing experience was using CITRAN (which was commonly known as SHITRAN). My first <em>pleasant</em> time-sharing experience was using TECO (TExt COrrector) and SOS (Son Of Stopgap) on Digital Equipment Corporation computers using a 110 baud interactive teletype machine. (The joke was that it was very difficult to differentiate TECO commands from line noise - since phone lines were very noisy in the old days.) Emacs (Editor MACroS) began as a set of macros for TECO and then grew to be the hydralike creature it is today. I will show you the commands I commonly use in writing programs (I will even hand out my <em>cheat sheet</em> for these commands on a sheet of paper!) and hopefully discuss the commands you would like to use. I will come prepared with the emacs reference manual and lisp manual!</p>

<p>On Thursday October 29th, 2009, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we will be presenting on how to configure the Linux kernel. If you have ever been lost when trying to compile or make menuconfig just confused you so much that you wanted to pull your hair out, then this meeting is for you. A few of our members will be making a collaborative effort on this topic so bring your questions to us and we will do our best to help. We will be going over how to compile a kernel the Debian way, the Gentoo way, and we also will be giving a general overview of the process as a whole so that it can be better understood. Bring your questions and concerns, we will be happy to address them.</p>
